The Machine Learning Process is useful in generalizing while building our ml models:
It is a 3 step approach:-
1.Data Preprocessing
  ->Import the Data
  ->Clean the Data
  ->Split the data into training and test sets
2.Modelling
  ->Build the model
  ->Train the model
  ->Make predictions
3.Evaluation
  ->Calculate performance metrics
  ->Make a verdict

We split the dataset into two parts:
Training Set and Testing Set
Training Set
It is used for building the model
Testing Set
It is used to make predictions and then compare the made predictions with the actual values and check how the model is performing.
This split happens before building the model.
Usually the split ration between training dataset to testing dataset is in ratio 80:20
